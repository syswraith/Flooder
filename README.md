# Flooder

## Introduction

**Flooder** is a simple looping batch script that calls itself again and again, in an endless loop. The executer must be careful while handling this script, because even if not run as an administrator, it can create a lot of changes that may not always be easy to reverse.

**Use it at your own risk. I am not responsible for anything that may do. This is one of the many projects that I undertook while learning batch scripting.**

## Functions

If run as **administrator** Flooder can:-
1. Create multiple, random user accounts.
2. Create multiple, random folders.
3. Create multiple windows of applications.

## How to run

1. Either download this repository or copy the code in a text editor and save the file as **.bat**.
2. Open the file. That's it. It's that easy.
